In the software development some libraries were used on the Arduíno platform to perform the control and supervision of the temperature control. 
These libraries made in C++ adapted for Arduíno are:
- SimpleModbusSlave (Modbus communication protocol library)
- Thermistor (Temperature sensor library for temperature measurement)
- PID_v1 (System controller library for performing process control)
- The controller was developed by modeling the system in Matlab, the parameters(Kp,Kd,Ki) obtained were used in the developed software.
